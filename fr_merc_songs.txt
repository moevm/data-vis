"There Must Be More To Life Than This"
There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life than this
How do we cope in a world without love
Mending all those broken hearts and tending to those crying faces
There must be more to life than living
There must be more than meets the eye
Why should it be just a case of black or white
There must be more to life than this

Why is this world so full of hate
People dying everywhere
And we destroy what we create
People fighting for their human rights
But we just go on saying c'est la vie
So this is life

There must be more to life than killing
A better way for us to survive
What good is life, if in the end we all must die,
There must be more to life than this

There must be more to life than this
there must be more to life than this
I live and hope for a world filled with love
Then we can all just live in peace
there must be more to life, much more to life,
There must be more to life,more to life than this


"Living On My Own"
Sometimes I feel I'm gonna break down and cry

"Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow"
You had to kill the conversation
You always had the upper hand
Got caught in love and stepped in sinking sand
You had to go and ruin all our plans
Packed your bags and you're leaving home
Got a one-way ticket and you're all set to go
But we have one more day together, so

Love me like there's no tomorrow
Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over
But today just love me like there's no tomorrow

I guess we drift alone in separate ways
I don't have all that far to go
God knows I've learnt to play the lonely man
I've never felt so low in all my life
We were born to be just losers
So I guess there's a limit on how far we go
But we only have one more day together, so

Love me like there's no tomorrow
Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over
But today just love me like there's no tomorrow

Tomorrow, God knows just where I'll be
Tomorrow, who knows just what's in store for me
Anything can happen, but we only have one more day together, yeah
Just one more day forever, so

Love me like there's no tomorrow
Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over
But today just love me like there's no tomorrow

So, Love me like there's no tomorrow
Hold me in your arms, tell me you mean it
This is our last goodbye and very soon it will be over
But today just love me like there's no tomorrow

"Barcelona"
I had this perfect dream
-Un sueño me envolvió
This dream was me and you
-Tal vez estás aquí
I want all the world to see
-Un instinto me guiaba
A miracle sensation
My guide and inspiration
Now my dream is slowly coming true
 
The wind is a gentle breeze
-Él me habló de ti
The bells are ringing out
-El canto vuela
They're calling us together
Guiding us forever
Wish my dream would never go away
 
Barcelona - It was the first time that we met
Barcelona - How can I forget
The moment that you stepped into the room you took my breath away
Barcelona - La musica vibró
Barcelona - Y ella nos unió
And if God willing we will meet again, someday
 
Let the songs begin
-Déjalo nacer
Let the music play
-Ahhhhhhhh...
Make the voices sing
-Nace un gran amor
Start the celebration
-Ven a mi
And cry
-Grita
Come alive
-Vive
And shake the foundations from the skies
Ah, Ah, Shaking all our lives
 
Barcelona - Such a beautiful horizon
Barcelona - Like a jewel in the sun
Por ti seré gaviota de tu bella mar
Barcelona - Suenan las campanas
Barcelona - Abre tus puertas al mundo
If God is willing
-If God is willing
If God is willing
Friends until the end
Viva - Barcelona



"La Japonaise"
I feel the power of the stranger inside me
A force of magic surrounds me
This fountain within me is overflowing
 
Peaceful and inviting, beautiful and enticing
 
Rising sun will bless my morning with a smile
A magic pearl from the seas, born in a willow breeze
Loyal friend my guardian angel in the sky
You've served me well all these years
Greeting with both hands, trusting with no fears, till the end
 
When everything is golden and everything is oh
And everything is ah
My only living treasure on this earth
 
When everything is golden, everything and everyone is ah




"The Fallen Priest"
Free me, free yourself
A life of sacrifice controlled me
But those promises I made no longer hold me
Mercurial more wayward by the hour
The shackles fall away, I'm in your power

Free me, and free yourself
Come to me and let me lead you
I beg you, I beseech you to let go
My heaven is yours and heaven is all I know

We are mortal
In the hands of Gods who roll the dice
Searching for an earthly paradise
So hard to find
We are mortal
We are victims of our weaknesses and passion
We are reaching for the heights
(I am falling, I am falling from the heights)

But I promised I would serve
I should be a rock against depravity and sin
Oh no sin no sin
Free yourself, let your life begin, oh
To yourself be true
I am a man of God
I should not be here with you

Free me we are mortal, ah

Come a little closer to the fire
To love and live that one desire
Denial of that love is treason
The love that we make
The force of our lives and its reason

We are mortal
In the hands of Gods who roll the dice
Searching for an earthly paradise
So hard to find
We are mortal
Victims of our weaknesses and passion
(I am falling, I am falling we, we are mortal)

Why do I believe in you
You're destroying my world
Hold nothing back
Give me all there is
I want it all

This is where we stand
This is all there is
Prisoners of each others love
Prisoners of each others love

"Ensueño"
En mi sueno te ve
Tu luz llegaba de tan lejos

Tu voz penetra en mi
Vibra en ti
Vibra en mi

Suavemente me llevaba a ti
O¡ el sonido

Tu voz dulcemente
Me dec¡a: "Ven"
"Ven junto a mi"

Volver a vivir
Saber que mi sueño no est solo. Alienta en ti
T£ y yo cantando los dos

Yo so¤aba en ser tu mismo mar, tu mar,
Es peunte de unión
De nuestras almas

Vuelan, nos llaman
Al son de eternidad



"The Golden Boy"
The boy had a way with words, he sang, he moved with grace
He entertained so naturally, no gesture out of place
His road in life was clearly drawn, he didn't hesitate
He played, they saw, he conquered as the master of, as the master of his
fate
 
The girl had an iron soul no-one could recognise
Material ambition that her gentleness disguised
She gave herself to him certain of his fame
Wanted him for luxury, for limelight and his name
 
And then he sang to her
 
I love you for your silence, I love you for your peace
The still and calm releases that sweep into my soul
That slowly take control
 
I love you for your passion, I love you for your fire
The violent desire that burns me in its flame
A love I dare not name
 
His rise was irresistible (yeah) - he grew into the part
His explanation simply that he suffered for his art
No base considerations of some glittering reward
The prize was knowing that his work was noticed and adored
 
I love you (yes I love you) for your silence, I love you for your peace
The still and calm releases that sweep into my soul
That slowly slowly take control
 
Yes he told the truth (he told the truth), yes he told the truth
Accepting every honour with a masterly display
Of well rehearsed reluctance to be singled out this way
He started to believe that he was all they said and more (and more)
While she forgot, she forgot the reasons (reasons)
She had wanted him before
 
(I love you) I love you for your passion (for your passion)
I love you for your fire
The violent desire that burns me in its flame (burns me in its flame)
A love I dare not name
 
The still and calm releases (releases)
That sweep into my soul (sweep into my soul)
That slowly (slowly) slowly (slowly)
Slowly (slowly) slowly (slowly) take control
 
And when at last they fell apart, she wished that she could be
The hardened heart of yesterday, as cynical as he
By changing for the better, she had changed things for the worse
The words that made them happy once now echoed - echoed as a curse
"Guide Me Home"
Now the wind has lost my sail
Now the scent has left my trail
Who will find me, take care and side with me
Guide me back safely to my home
Where I belong, once more
 
Where is my star in heaven's bough
Where is my strength, I need it now
Who can save me, lead me to my destiny
Guide me back safely to my home
Where I belong, once more
 
Who will find me, take care and side with me
Guide me back safely to my home
Where I belong, once more
 
How can I go on?
How can I go on this way


"How Can I Go On"
When all the salt is taken from the sea
I stand dethroned, I'm naked and I bleed
But when your finger points so savagely
Is anybody there to believe in me
To hear my plea and take care of me?
 
How can I go on, from day to day
Who can make me strong in every way
Where can I be safe, where can I belong
In this great big world of sadness
How can I forget those beautiful dreams that we shared
They're lost and they're nowhere to be found
How can I go on?
 
Sometimes I seem to tremble in the dark, I cannot see
When people frighten me
I try to hide myself so far from the crowd
Is anybody there to comfort me
Lord, take care of me
 
How can I go on (how can I go on)
From day to day (from day to day)
Who can make me strong (who can make me strong)
In every way (in every way)
Where can I be safe (where can I be safe)
Where can I belong (where can I belong)
In this great big world of sadness
(In this great big world of sadness)
How can I forget (how can I forget)
Those beautiful dreams that we shared
(Those beautiful dreams that we shared)
They're lost and they're nowhere to be found
How can I go on?
 
How can I go on? How can I go on? Go on, go on, go on


"Overture Piccante"
Ah ah ah ah
Shaking all our lives
Oooooh

Guide me back once more
To yourself be true

eurt eb dog fo nam
nam a ma I, nam a ma I

Yoake kisetsu yume kibo
Umito hikariga youdeilu

Yes he told the truth (and he told the truth)
I love you for your silence
I love you for your peace (I love peace)
Sweep into my soul
Oooh - Slowly take control

Sing it sing it sing it sing it sing it sing it sing it sing it
We are mortal
In the hands of gods who roll the dice
We are mortal
Victims of our weaknesses


"Goin' Back"
Going back
think I'm going back
To the things I learnt so well in my youth
I think I'm returning to
Those days when I was young enough to know the truth
Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more colouring books
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can't play the game of life to win
I can recall a time
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than just my toys to lend
Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
And every day can be
My magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears
And live my days instead of counting my years
Then everyone debates
The true reality
I'd rather see the world
The way it used to be
A little bit of freedom's all we lack
So catch me if you can
I'm going back




"Hold On"
Hold on, shake hands
Don't let's fight, yeah, let's be friends
 
(Hold on) We were having fun together
(Shake hands) Instead we'll have fun now that you are gone
(Don't lets fight) I just wanted to have a free hand
(Let's be friends)
 
(Hold on) You know I tried to be a good girl
(Shake hands) Then I went and let you down
(Don't let's fight) I will search, you had better want to play around
(I'm so bad) so bad (so bad) so bad (so bad)
 
Baby you're really something
You're really something to me
You've got a flame in my heart
We ain't never gonna part
Hey baby, you're something to me
 
Baby you're really something
You're really something to me

We ain't never gonna part
Hey baby you're something to me
 
Baby you're really something, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah


"I Can Hear Music"
This is the way
I always dreamed it would be
The way that it is, oh no
When you are holding me
I never had a love of my own
Maybe that's why when we're all alone

I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby
Seems to disappear, oh when
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near

Loving you
It keeps me satisfied
And I can't explain, oh no
The way I'm feeling inside
You look at me we kiss and then
I close my eyes and here it comes again

I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby
Seems to disappear, oh when
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near

I can hear music
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near
[repeat]


"In My Defence"
In my defence what is there to say
All the mistakes we made must be faced today
It's not easy now knowing where to start
While the world we love tears itself apart
I'm just a singer with a song
How can I try to right the wrong
For just a singer with a melody
I'm caught in between
With a fading dream

In my defence what is there to say
We destroy the love - it's our way
We never listen enough never face the truth
Then like a passing song
Love is here and then it's gone

I'm just a singer with a song
How can I try to right the wrong
For just a singer with a melody
I'm caught in between
With a fading dream

I'm just a singer with a song
How can I try to right the wrong
I'm just a singer with a melody
I'm caught in between with a fading dream
Caught in between with a fading dream
Caught in between with a fading dream

Oh what on earth
Oh what on earth
How do I try
Do we live or die

Oh help me God
Please help me

"The Great Pretender"
(originally by The Platters)

Oh yes I'm the great pretender (ooh ooh)
Pretending I'm doing well (ooh ooh)
My need is such I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell

Oh yes I'm the great pretender (ooh ooh)
Adrift in a world of my own (ooh ooh)
I play the game but to my real shame
You've left me to dream all alone

Too real is this feeling of make believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Ooh Ooh yes I'm the great pretender (ooh ooh)
Just laughing and gay like a clown (ooh ooh)
I seem to be what I'm not (you see)
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

Yeah ooh hoo
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Oh yes I'm the great pretender
Just laughing and gay like a clown (ooh ooh)
I seem to be what I'm not you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're
Pretending that you're still around




"Time"
Time waits for nobody
We all must plan our hopes together
Or we'll have no more future at all
Time waits for nobody
 
We might as well be deaf and dumb and blind
I know that sounds unkind
But it seems to me we've not listened to
Or spoken about it at all
The fact that time is running out for us all
 
Time waits for nobody
Time waits for no-one
We've got to build this world together
Or we'll have no more future at all
Because time - it waits for nobody
 
You don't need me to tell you what's gone wrong (gone wrong gone wrong)
You know what's going on
But it seems to me we've not cared enough
Or confided in each other at all (confided in each other at all)
It seems that we've all got our backs against the wall
 
(Time) Time waits for nobody

We've got to trust in one another
Or there'll be no more future at all
